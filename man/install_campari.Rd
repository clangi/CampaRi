\title{Installing the original Fortran code}
\usage{
install_campari(campari_source = NULL, installation_location = NULL,
  install_ncminer = FALSE, install_threads = FALSE, install_mpi = FALSE,
  silent_built = FALSE, no_optimization = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{campari_source}{Location string of the CAMPARI structure (it will test for the presence of source/chainsaw.f90). If not provided it will try the standard 
inst/extdata/for_campari or the main repository.}

\item{installation_location}{It defaults to the package installation path (package/inst/campari) but this can be copied in another directory and installed from there.
NB: it will contain a source directory with its configure file and therefore must be executable.}

\item{install_ncminer}{If true the executable for netcdf and ascii (tsv, csv) file handling will be installed on the top of normal installation.}

\item{install_threads}{If this option is true and you have some multithreading fortran compiler (e.g. openmp) the campari_threads will be installed.}

\item{install_mpi}{If this option is true and you have some MPI fortran compiler the campari_mpi will be installed.}

\item{silent_built}{The configuration and make step will not print anything to console.}

\item{no_optimization}{The configuration and make step will not print anything to console.}
}
\description{
\code{install_campari} is able to install the original campari Fortran code in the default directory (package/inst) or in a specified one. 
     Please remember that make and configure are two fundamental steps in this process.
