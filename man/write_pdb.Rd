\title{Writing a pdb file from trajectory matrix in R}
\usage{
write_pdb(trj, file_name, seq_name = NULL, method = "automatic_safe",
  round = FALSE, digit = 4, dim_check = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{trj}{Time series in a matrix shape (also data.frame numeric). The number of variables (nrow) must be divisible by 3 for atom-like pdb writing.}

\item{file_name}{File name of the output pdb (e.g. BPTI.pdb).}

\item{seq_name}{Sequence name of the output .in file (principally used by CAMPARI).}

\item{method}{default method will use automatic_safe support to write pdb file (other methods are 'bio3d', 'automatic_unsafe'). With bio3d extra options will be passed to write.pdb function.
The first one uses an old system with printf. The other one is fragile for large dimensions and negative values.}

\item{round}{\code{TRUE} will truncate the output following the \code{digit} variable.}

\item{digit}{Number of digits that will be kept from truncation (\code{round}).}

\item{dim_check}{\code{TRUE} to check if number of columns is higher than number of rows and stop consequently.}

\item{...}{Extra variables for bio3d function write.pdb.}
}
\description{
\code{write.pdb.d} writes to file a pdb file with the trajectory matrix in input.
     The number of variables (number of columns) must be divisible by 3 to mantain the atomic 3D structure.
